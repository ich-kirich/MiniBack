  191 - Append Argument ------- by Maciej Sikora (@maciejsikora) #medium #arguments
  ### Question
  For given function type `Fn`, and any type `A` (any in this context means we don't restrict the type, and I don't have in mind any type ðŸ˜‰) 
  create a generic type which will take `Fn` as the first argument, `A` as the second, 
  and will produce function type `G` which will be the same as `Fn` but with appended argument `A` as a last one.
  For example,

  type Fn = (a: number, b: string) => number

  type Result = AppendArgument<Fn, boolean>
  // expected be (a: number, b: string, x: boolean) => number

*/
// Solution
type AppendArgument<Fn, A> = Fn extends (...args: infer P) => infer R
  ? (...args: [...P, A]) => R
  : never;
